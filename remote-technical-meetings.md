#### Best Practices for Remote Technical Meetings 
Given the global COVID-19 situation I think technical teams would gain from some guidelines & best practices for making time spent as productive as possible.


### Audio & Video Conferencing
It's important to be inclusive and use the tools that allow the team to be most productive. This may mean we all have to learn new tools and software.

## When using Microsoft Teams
Use a Microsoft Teams Site for collaboration during the session(s). Teams allows users to do things like:
  - Collaborate with shared & threaded conversations that are not real-time. This allows people to work across time zones & projects.
  - Collaborate in real-time with instant messaging/chat features.
  - Share files in a project-based file share.
  - Schedule audio & video calls for meetings, screen sharing and remote control.


## When using Zoom:
Zoom is also another popular option and I've used it (at customers request) many times. Even without a user account Zoom allows you to specify the name you'd like to use for the meeting (with option to remember) as well as automatically connect audio & turn off/on video. Default setting for Zoom seems to have video turned on so be prepared to share your webcam video unless you check the box to turn this off before joining (you can also easily turn it off after joining).

### Before the Meetings
There are some things to consider before the meetings when it comes to planning for the meeting, preparing your workspace and ensuring minimal interruptions during the meeting.

## Agenda Planning
It's important to consider how long everyone will be sitting at their desk/workstation.
  - Consider breakout sessions for specific topics and/or smaller group discussions

## Preparing your Surroundings


## During the Meetings

  - Pin one camera view to the big screen
  - Be the first to make a comment in chat so people see that as an option 
  - Ask more questions to encourage dialogue
  - Take long pauses to foster feedback from everyone


# Use Video/Webcam
Sharing your video/webcam provides a more personal connection to people. However, if network connevtivity or bandwidth is an issue it may be better to turn video off for larger portions of the meeting or allow the host to share video while others turn their cams off.

## Remote Whiteboarding
It's a good idea to use a shared whiteboard, where many people can participate. This will most simulate a physical whiteboard where anyone can start drawing. Most digital whiteboards that a part of remote meeting tools allow you to use a pen/stylus, mouse or your finger (when touchscreen is available). 

## With Microsoft Whiteboard

  - Keep in mind that Ink to Shape capability, while nice for making easier to understand drawings, it makes things harder to erase (must use select tool + delete, vs. erase tool).

## With Microsoft Teams Whiteboard



## Using Surface Pen
Some of these tips may also apply to other stylus or pen tools. Surface Pen & Samsung S-Pen is what I've used the most. 
  - Make sure you have some extra AAAA batteries available just in case (unless you have a rechargable Surface Slim Pen).
  - See note about Ink to Shape, flipping Pen to eraser won't erase Ink to Shapes.

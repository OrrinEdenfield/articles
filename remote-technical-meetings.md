#### Best Practices for Remote Technical Meetings 
Given the global COVID-19 situation I think technical teams would gain from some guidelines & best practices for making time spent as productive as possible.


### Audio & Video Conferencing
It's important to be inclusive and use the tools that allow the team to be most productive. This may mean we all have to learn new tools and software.

## When using Microsoft Teams
Use a Microsoft Teams Site for collaboration during the session(s). Teams allows users to do things like:
  - Collaborate with shared & threaded conversations that are not real-time. This allows people to work across time zones & projects.
  - Collaborate in real-time with instant messaging/chat features.
  - Share files in a project-based file share.
  - Schedule audio & video calls for meetings, screen sharing and remote control.


## When using Zoom:
Zoom is also another popular option and I've used it (at customers request) many times. Even without a user account Zoom allows you to specify the name you'd like to use for the meeting (with option to remember) as well as automatically connect audio & turn off/on video. Default setting for Zoom seems to have video turned on so be prepared to share your webcam video unless you check the box to turn this off before joining (you can also easily turn it off after joining).

### Before the Meetings
There are some things to consider before the meetings when it comes to planning for the meeting, preparing your workspace and ensuring minimal interruptions during the meeting.
